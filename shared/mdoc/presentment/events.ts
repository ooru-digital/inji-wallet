/**
 * Presentment event names, kept in a leaf module with no imports of its own.
 *
 * Both engines emit these: the Android native Multipaz module sends them over the RN bridge, and
 * the common TypeScript engine sends them through its local emitter. `../iso18013PresentmentInterop`
 * re-exports them so existing importers are unaffected.
 *
 * They live here rather than in that file because the TS engine and the interop layer import
 * from each other — the interop layer dispatches into the engine, and the engine emits events the
 * interop layer defines. Holding the constants in a module neither side owns breaks the cycle;
 * the *types* can stay in the interop layer since `import type` is erased at runtime.
